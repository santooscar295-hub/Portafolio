This project demonstrates a structured approach to network traffic analysis
from a Security Operations Center (SOC) perspective. The objective is to
understand normal network behavior, simulate controlled traffic patterns,
and identify characteristics that could support detection and investigation
decisions.

The analysis is divided into three phases: baseline traffic observation,
controlled HTTP traffic simulation, and comparative detection analysis.

Project Objectives
1.Establish a baseline of normal network traffic.
2.Analyze DNS, TCP, HTTPS, and HTTP communication patterns.
3.Simulate controlled traffic in a lab environment.
4.Identify potential indicators of suspicious activity.
5.Apply SOC-oriented analytical reasoning.

Phase 1 – Baseline Traffic Analysis
Goal:
Identify and document normal network traffic behavior.

Key Activities:
Captured traffic generated by typical user activity.
Analyzed DNS queries and responses.
Observed encrypted HTTPS traffic and TLS handshakes.
Verified stable TCP sessions and legitimate communication patterns.
Outcome:
A reliable baseline used as a reference point for anomaly detection and
false-positive reduction.

Phase 2 – Simulated HTTP Traffic
Goal:
Observe repetitive and predictable traffic patterns in a controlled
environment.

Lab Setup:
Windows virtual machine acting as the client.
Linux virtual machine providing an HTTP service.
Traffic captured using Wireshark.
Key Observations:
Clear-text HTTP GET requests.
Repetitive request-and-response patterns.
Consistent HTTP 200 OK responses.
Communication limited to internal hosts.
Outcome:
Demonstrated how legitimate but repetitive traffic may appear suspicious
when compared against baseline behavior.

Phase 3 – Detection and Comparison
Goal:
Compare baseline traffic with simulated activity to identify potential
detection indicators.

Potential Indicators Identified:
Repetitive HTTP requests at regular intervals.
Use of unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS.
Communication with a single destination.
Predictable and automated request patterns.

Limitations:
Network-level analysis only.
No endpoint or host-based telemetry.
Controlled lab environment without external variability.

Tools Used:
Wireshark.
Windows PowerShell.
Linux command-line utilities.
Virtualized lab environment.

Skills Demonstrated:
Network traffic analysis.
DNS, HTTP, and TLS protocol understanding.
Wireshark filtering and interpretation.
Baseline comparison methodology.
SOC-oriented investigation mindset.

Disclaimer
All traffic analyzed in this project was generated in a controlled laboratory
environment. No malicious activity was performed, and no sensitive or
personal data was captured.
